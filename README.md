# Predicting_User_Preferences
I created a recommender system using Python scikit named Surprise. The purpose of building this system is to predict a person's preferences so the user can find what they are looking for faster. I used a 2018 Amazon Electronics dataset to create a prediction tool based on user IDs, product IDs from the electronics sold on Amazon, and the overall rating assigned by users who reviewed the electronic products sold on Amazon.
